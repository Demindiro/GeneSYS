x86-64 / x64 / AMD64 / IA32e
============================

Two types of kernels are provided:

- UEFI / BIOS compatible
- Unikernel (**TODO**)

The UEFI / BIOS kernel is intended for use on real hardware.

The unikernel is designed for "cloud" VPSes: small virtual machines
typically dedicated to a single application.

Only the UEFI/BIOS compatible kernels provide security and debugging tools.
The unikernel is designed to minimize overhead and to utilize debugging tools
provided by the hypervisor.


Supported hardware
------------------

- Memory
- MMU
- UART (COM1/COM2)
- PCI / PCIe (**TODO**)
- VirtIO (unikernel)
  - block (**TODO**)
  - net (**TODO**)
